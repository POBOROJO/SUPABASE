                text: "Tanks are armored fighting vehicles that combine firepower, mobility, and protection. They are designed to engage in close-range combat with enemy forces and provide support to infantry units.\n\n**Key Features of Tanks:**\n\n**1. Firepower:**\n* Tanks are equipped with powerful main guns, typically ranging from 75mm to 125mm in caliber.\n* They also carry secondary weapons such as coaxial machine guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, and grenade launchers.\n\n**2. Mobility:**\n* Tanks are designed to be highly mobile and maneuverable on various terrains.\n* They have powerful engines and suspension systems that enable them to navigate rough terrain, cross obstacles, and move at speeds of up to 70 km/h.\n\n**3. Protection:**\n* Tanks are heavily armored with thick plates of steel or composite materials.\n* This armor protects the crew, engine, and other critical components from enemy fire, including armor-piercing rounds, artillery shells, and guided missiles.\n\n**4. Crew:**\n* Tanks typically have a crew of 2-4 members: commander, gunner, loader, and driver.\n* The commander directs the crew and coordinates with other units, while the gunner operates the main gun, the loader handles the ammunition, and the driver controls the tank's movement.\n\n**Types of Tanks:**\n\n**1. Main Battle Tanks (MBTs):**\n* The most common type of tank, designed to provide a balance of firepower, mobility, and protection.\n* Examples: M1 Abrams (USA), Leopard 2 (Germany), T-90 (Russia)\n\n**2. Light Tanks:**\n* Smaller and lighter than MBTs, sacrificing some protection for increased speed and maneuverability.\n* Used for reconnaissance, flank attacks, and support roles.\n* Examples: PT-76 (Russia), FV101 Scorpion (UK)\n\n**3. Heavy Tanks:**\n* Heavily armored and armed, designed for breakthrough operations against fortified enemy positions.\n* Examples: T-34 (Russia), Tiger I (Germany)\n\n**4. Specialized Tanks:**\n* Designed for specific roles, such as anti-aircraft defense, engineering, and urban combat.\n* Examples: Gepard (Germany), Merkava (Israel), M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (USA)\n\nTanks play a crucial role in modern warfare, providing combined arms capabilities to support infantry, artillery, and air units. Their advanced technology and versatility make them formidable weapons on the battlefield.",
